Two Perpsectives on Happiness

"Sometimes I feel so happy. Sometimes I feel so sad. Sometimes I feel so happy but mostly you just make me mad" -Lou Reed

Looking out into the world I see two narratives about happiness. The first is that it is something that can be bought and sold. Something that is the product of material goods, in particular material goods attached to corporate branding. The second is that it is something internal and personal. Something which is almost a choice to be made. Something that a rational person would come to after meditative reflection if they could avoid being caught up in the materialistic perspective brought to their consciousess by the commercial signaling which surrounds them. The first perspective on happiness is never stated explicitly. But it is in the air. Its implied in every ad and billboard. In every store and bar. The second perspective is advanced explicitly to combat the grossness of the first one. Happiness is not a can of Coca Cola. Its not getting a promotion or having a large balance in your bank account.

I'm here to give a small defense of the first perspective.
