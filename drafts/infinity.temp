An Infinity of Infinities

Once upon a time I imagined infinity as a monolithic concept. Simply what came after the finite. There are lots of finite numbers, infinitely many, and after that there is infinity. But in fact their is a rich garden of infinities to explore we just need to get better at counting. 

What even is counting? We learned so long ago its easy to forget what we're really doing. If I ask you to tell me how many words are on this page you might go "One, Two, Three..." as you look from word to word.
