	"Summary": "In this post I talk about some changes I've made to my website. For instance I've implemented a small summary feature so I can give my readers a blurb about what they're going to get into before they click on my blog and get sucked into some writing they have no investment in. Which is of course a greater and greater risk as I expand my audience to millions."
